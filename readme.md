# Textbox++

A `<textarea>` with benefits:

- **Syntax highlighting** based on arbitrary regular expressions, with arbitrary CSS.
- **Keyboard shortcuts** to insert any text, or to surround the selected text with anything.
- **Events** to inform you when the user's cursor has entered or left something.

## Dependencies
Requires [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), which it expects to find in the `$` variable.

## Credits
Includes the [Autoresize](https://github.com/jackmoore/autosize) script by Jack Moore.
